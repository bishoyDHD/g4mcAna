# g4mcAna
Analysis code for e36G4MC

This example is rather straightforward to run, simply do the following:
 1. Create a build directroy in the g4mcAna/ dir:
    ~$ cd g4mcAna/
    ~$ mkdir buildAna

 2. Change into the buildAna/ dir:
    ~$ cd buildAna

 3. Create a build environment by running cmake and compile using make:
    ~$ cmake ../
    ~$ make -jN
    Here N represents the number of cores. Make sure that cmake has successfully created a build environment.

   RUNNING THE ANALYSIS ROUTINE
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The first thing to do is to run the help command once you have successfully compiled the analysis package as follows:

 ~$ ./e36g4mcAna -h # Will print the help menu

Alternatively:
 ~$ ./e36g4mcAna    # Will also print the help menu

Unless the channel number is specified, the e36g4mcAna will assume the default channel (7).
Simply perform the analysis of a ROOT file as follows:

 ~$ ./e36g4mcAna -[opt1] -[opt2] /path/to/G4Sim.root
